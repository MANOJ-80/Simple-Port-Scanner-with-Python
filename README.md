# Simple-Port-Scanner-with-Python🐍🔍🔒

## Overview

This Python script performs a simple port scan on a target host. It checks whether a specific port on the host is open or closed, providing a basic tool for network exploration and security assessment. The script utilizes Python's built-in socket library to establish connections and determine the status of the targeted port.
